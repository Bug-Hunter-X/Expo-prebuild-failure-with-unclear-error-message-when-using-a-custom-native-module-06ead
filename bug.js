This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command in conjunction with a custom native module that has issues linking or building within the context of the Expo managed workflow.  The underlying cause can vary, but often involves complexities with native dependencies, platform-specific configurations (Android vs. iOS), or incorrect build configurations in the project's `android` and `ios` directories.
