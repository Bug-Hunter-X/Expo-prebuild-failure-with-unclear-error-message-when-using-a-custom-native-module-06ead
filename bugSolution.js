The precise solution depends on the specific native module and the error message received.  However, common strategies for resolving this type of issue include:

1. **Thoroughly check the native module's documentation:**  Ensure that you've followed all the steps for integration correctly.
2. **Examine the build logs:** The logs often provide clues about the specific failure. Look for errors related to missing dependencies, incorrect paths, or other problems.
3. **Verify native dependencies:**  Make sure all required native dependencies for your module are correctly installed and linked.
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes a simple `expo prebuild --clean` can resolve transient issues.
5. **Check platform-specific configurations:** Pay close attention to the `android/app/build.gradle` and `ios/{projectName}/Podfile` files, ensuring that all paths and configurations are accurate.
6. **Simplify the module (if possible):** If you have a complex native module, attempt to isolate the problematic part to pinpoint the source of the error.
7. **Consult the Expo community:** Seek help from the Expo forums or community channels; others might have encountered a similar issue.
